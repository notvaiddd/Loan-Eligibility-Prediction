 Logic Explanation:
- The code prepares input features: monthly income, credit score, loan amount, and employment status, along with label (eligibility) from a dataset.

- It uses the Logistic Regression algorithm to:
  - Learn the relationship between the input features and the eligibility outcome.
  - The model is trained on historical data to understand patterns that affect eligibility decisions.
- After training, the model can take new input data (e.g., income, credit score, etc.) and predict loan eligibility based on the patterns it has learned.
- Logistic Regression computes the probability of eligibility using a weighted sum of the features.
- The final result is binary:
  - Eligible (1) or Not Eligible (0), based on a probability threshold.
- This approach allows for more dynamic and flexible decision-making compared to static rule-based methods.

 Tech Stack Used:
- Python: The primary programming language for the project.
- Pandas: For handling and manipulating the dataset.
- NumPy: To perform numerical operations on arrays.
- Scikit-learn: For machine learning, including the Logistic Regression model and splitting the dataset for training and testing.
- Logistic Regression: A classification algorithm used to predict binary outcomes based on input features.
